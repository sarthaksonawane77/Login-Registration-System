Login and registration system using Java, HTML/CSS, and SQL

Overview
A simple login and registration system built with Java (backend), HTML/CSS (frontend), and SQL (database). The project demonstrates basic full-stack integration by connecting user input forms with backend logic and storing credentials securely in a database.

Features:
User registration with input validation
Secure password storage using hashing
Login functionality with credential verification
Basic frontend interface with HTML/CSS forms
SQL database integration for storing and retrieving user data

Tech Stack:
Java (Core & OOP concepts)
HTML & CSS for frontend
SQL (MySQL) for database
JDBC for backend-database connection

Purpose:
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate Java applications with a database, handle user input, and create functional backend logic linked to a frontend interface. It also shows practical application of OOP principles and basic full-stack development concepts.
